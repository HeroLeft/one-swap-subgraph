# One Swap Subgraph
SubGraph takes information about events directly from the smart contract and allows you to get information about the approvals and transfers.

A live version of this subgraph can be found [here](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/heroleft/one-swap), along with useful queries and examples already available on the playground.
